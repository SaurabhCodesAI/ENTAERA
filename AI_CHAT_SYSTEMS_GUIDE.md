## 💬 Example Interactions

### Code Generation
```
You: generate a python fibonacci function
🤖 AI: Here's a Python function to generate Fibonacci numbers:

def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Test the function
for i in range(10):
    print(f"F({i}) = {fibonacci(i)}")
```

### Framework Questions
```
You: what can ENTAERA do?
🤖 AI: I'm integrated with ENTAERA's modules including:
- Code Generation (32KB): Create code in various languages
- Semantic Search (65KB): Search documents and information
- Agent Orchestration (86KB): Coordinate multiple AI agents
- [Lists actual confirmed modules only]
```

### Honest Responses
```
You: what katas does ENTAERA have?
🤖 AI: I don't have information about specific katas in ENTAERA. 
I can see I'm integrated with the core modules, but I don't have 
details about training exercises or examples.
```
