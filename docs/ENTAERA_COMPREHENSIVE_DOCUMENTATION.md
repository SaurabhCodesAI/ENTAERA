```bash
python entaera_enhanced_chat.py
```

This provides:
- Multi-API routing
- Context-aware responses
- Error detection and correction
- API status monitoring

### Smart Routing Examples

Example routing scenarios:

```python
# Financial data query â†’ Routes to Perplexity
"What is Elon Musk's current net worth?"

# Technical/coding query â†’ Routes to Azure OpenAI
"Write a Python function to calculate Fibonacci numbers"

# Simple general knowledge â†’ Routes to Gemini
"What is the capital of France?"

# Project-specific query â†’ Uses context awareness
"Tell me about the ENTAERA project"
```

### Forcing Specific Providers

You can bypass the smart routing by prefixing commands:

```
azure: Tell me about quantum computing
gemini: What's the weather like today?
perplexity: Who won the latest NFL game?
```

### API Integration in Custom Code

Integrate ENTAERA into your own applications:

```python
from entaera.utils.api_router import SmartAPIRouter

# Initialize router
router = SmartAPIRouter()

# Get optimal response with automatic provider selection
response = await router.get_response(
    prompt="Analyze this research paper",
    context={"user": "Saurabh", "project": "ENTAERA"}
)

# Use specific provider
azure_response = await router.get_response(
    prompt="Explain quantum computing",
    provider="azure_openai"
)
```

## Advanced Features

### Context Awareness

ENTAERA maintains awareness of:

- **Project context**: Knowledge about ENTAERA framework
- **Personal context**: Recognition of creator/user identity
- **Conversation history**: Previous messages in current session

Example context injection:

```python
# Project context is automatically injected for relevant queries
response = await test_azure_openai_api(
    "Who created this project?",
    context=ENTAERA_CONTEXT
)
# Response acknowledges Saurabh Pareek as creator
```

### Error Detection & Correction

The system automatically detects problematic responses:

- **Outdated information**: Responses referring to past years
- **Generic refusals**: "I cannot provide..." or "I don't have access..."
- **Contextual errors**: Misunderstanding project or personal context

When detected, the system will:
1. Flag the problematic response
2. Attempt to get better information from alternative providers
3. Present the corrected response

### Cost Optimization

ENTAERA implements several cost-saving measures:

- **Token limiting**: Azure OpenAI configured for 3,000 tokens/minute
- **Provider selection**: Using cheaper APIs for simpler queries
- **Response caching**: Avoiding duplicate API calls for similar queries
- **Smart routing**: Directing queries to most cost-effective provider for the task

### Multi-API Fallback System

If a primary API fails or provides inadequate responses:

1. Error is detected and logged
2. System automatically tries alternative provider
3. If second provider fails, tries third option
4. Response quality is evaluated at each step
