# Day 3 Kata: File Handling and Data Structures

## Key Components

1. **DataFile Class**
   - Unified interface for handling different file formats (JSON, YAML, CSV, text)
   - Automatic file type detection based on extensions
   - Robust error handling with custom exception types
   - Atomic file operations with context managers
   - Backup functionality with timestamps

2. **DirectoryManager Class**
   - Directory traversal and management
   - File search by name, extension, and patterns
   - File statistics and metadata collection
   - Temporary directory management
   - Safe directory operations

3. **Error Handling System**
   - Custom exception hierarchy for file operations
   - Specialized exceptions for common error cases
   - Graceful degradation with informative error messages
   - Logging integration for debugging

## Implementation Highlights

### File Operations

- **File Type Detection**:
  - Automatic format detection based on file extensions
  - Support for JSON, YAML, CSV, text, and Markdown files

- **Data Serialization**:
  - JSON reading/writing with proper encoding
  - YAML processing with safe_load/safe_dump
  - CSV handling with header support
  - Text processing with UTF-8 encoding

- **Atomic Operations**:
  - Safe file writes using temporary files
  - Atomic rename operations (platform-aware)
  - Backup creation with timestamped files

### Directory Operations

- **Path Management**:
  - Cross-platform path handling with pathlib
  - Directory creation with parents
  - Recursive file listing and searching
  - File statistics and metadata collection

- **Search Capabilities**:
  - Find files by extension
  - Find files by name (case-sensitive or insensitive)
  - Find newest files
  - Get file statistics and sizes

### Error Handling

- **Exception Hierarchy**:
  - Base FileError exception
  - Specialized FileNotFoundError, FilePermissionError, etc.
  - Contextual error messages with file paths
  - Integration with logging system

## Learning Objectives Achieved

- File operations with pathlib
- Error handling patterns and custom exceptions
- JSON and YAML data serialization
- CSV processing with headers
- Safe file operations with atomic writes
- Context managers for resource management
- Directory traversal and management
- File backup and restoration
- Platform-independent file operations

## Next Steps

- Complete Days 4-7: Algorithm kata
- Progress through the 30-day roadmap
- Implement higher-level data structures and algorithms
