async def learn_cost_optimization():
    ai = ENTAERA(daily_budget=1.00)  # $1 daily budget
    
    # Monitor cost accumulation
    for i in range(10):
        response = await ai.chat(f"Question {i}: Tell me about AI")
        print(f"Query {i}: Cost ${response.cost:.4f}, Total: ${ai.total_cost:.4f}")
