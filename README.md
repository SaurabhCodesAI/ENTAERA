_My AI Integration Learning Journey_

Six months of real learning, problem-solving, and authentic growth. This is the story of building something that actually works—a multi-AI integration system that started as a curiosity and became a solid foundation for understanding modern AI development.

> "I thought I'd quickly connect a few APIs and build something cool. What I actually discovered was a 6-month journey of learning, debugging, and growing as a developer."

## 📖 The Development Timeline

### 🔥 Months 1-2: The Struggle
- **What I Tried:** Connect to my first AI API (Azure OpenAI).
- **What Happened:** It took three weeks just to get a basic, reliable connection.
- **Challenges Faced:**
  - Learning API authentication from scratch.
  - Correctly managing environment variables and secrets.
  - Basic error handling (my code crashed a lot initially).
- **Skills Gained:** API authentication, environment variable management, basic debugging, and reading technical documentation.

### ⚡ Months 3-4: Building Momentum
- **What I Tried:** Add more AI services (Google Gemini, Perplexity).
- **What Happened:** Each new service taught me something different about APIs, from rate limits to varied auth methods.
- **Challenges Faced:**
  - Different authentication methods for each service.
  - Rate limiting issues (I got blocked a few times).
  - Handling different JSON response formats.
- **Skills Developed:** API integration patterns, configuration management, better error handling, and logging.

### 🚀 Months 5-6: Making It Smarter
- **What I Tried:** Build a system to choose the right AI for different tasks.
- **What Happened:** I created the first version of the routing logic and significantly improved the overall code structure.
- **Skills That Emerged:** System design thinking, modular programming, testing strategies, and documentation.
