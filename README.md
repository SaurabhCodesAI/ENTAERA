Project Management:



Planning: Breaking big goals into manageable tasks Prioritization: Focusing on what matters most Communication: Documenting decisions and progress Quality Assurance: Testing and validating work

The Real Learning Journey



What I Thought This Would Be:



"I'll quickly connect a few APIs and build something cool"

What It Actually Was:



Weeks learning basic API concepts

Discovering the complexity of authentication

Understanding rate limits and error handling

Realizing good software takes time and iteration

Learning that documentation and testing matter

Finding joy in solving difficult problems

Most Valuable Lessons:



Start Simple: Get one thing working before adding complexity

Read Everything: Documentation, error messages, examples

Test Early: Don't wait until the end to see if things work

Document Everything: Your future self will thank you

Embrace Iteration: First versions don't have to be perfect

Learn from Failures: Every error teaches you something
