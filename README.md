# VertexAutoGPT

An autonomous agent designed for automated research and workflow optimization. VertexAutoGPT combines cutting-edge AI and cloud infrastructure to create a powerful, cost-effective tool for researchers, developers, and data scientists.

### **Features**

* **RLHF-Optimized Decision Loop:** A fine-tuned reward model ensures the agent's tool usage becomes more efficient and effective over time.
* **FAISS-Powered Memory:** The use of a FAISS vector database allows for blazing-fast long-term memory retrieval, improving the agent's contextual awareness and performance.
* **VertexAI Toolformer-style Tooling:** The agent dynamically selects the best tool for a task, including Google Search, code execution, and data summarization, directly from its prompt.
* **Cost-Minimized Infrastructure:** By leveraging GCP Preemptible instances, VertexAutoGPT reduces training and inference costs by up to 40% compared to standard cloud setups.

---

### **Capabilities**

* **Automated Research:** Ingests and summarizes 50+ research papers per week.
* **Dynamic Tool Use:** The agent's core loop intelligently selects and executes tools.
* **Reinforcement Learning:** Optimizes its own behavior through a reward feedback system.
* **High-Performance Memory:** Achieves 10K+ token recall with ~100ms latency.
